# Welcome to the Free/Libre and Open Source Hardware Assembly

The Free/Libre and Open Source Hardware (FLOSH) Assembly is a space to explore, discuss, and understand the principles and impact of FLOSH. This assembly focuses on the tools, processes, and challenges involved in creating and supporting FLOSH projects.

## What is FLOSH?

FLOSH refers to hardware whose design is made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and sell the design or hardware based on that design. This includes providing documentation such as CAD files, schematics, source code, and design files under appropriate licenses.

## The Problem of Open Source Hardware Washing

Open Hardware washing occurs when a product is labeled as Open Source Hardware but does not meet the requirements for being truly FLOSH. For hardware to be FLOSH, its design must be made publicly available so that anyone can study, modify, distribute, make, and distribute/sell the design or hardware based on that design.

When companies or projects use the term Open Source Hardware without sharing the necessary design files, source code, or documentation, or when they impose restrictions that prevent others from using or modifying the hardware, it creates confusion and misrepresentation. This practice can limit collaboration, restrict user freedom, and reduce the potential benefits of Open Source Hardware design.

To support Open Source Hardware, it is important to verify whether the necessary documentation and rights are fully accessible and meet the principles of FLOSH. Identifying and addressing Open Source Hardware washing ensures that the term retains its value and meaning.

## Examples of FLOSH Projects

Some projects demonstrate the principles of FLOSH:

- **OLSK (Open Lab starter Kit)**: Set of CERN licensed digital fabrication machines.
- **LibreSolar**: Building Blocks for Renewable Energy Systems.
- **MNT Reform**: A modular laptop project with documentation and design files for repair and modification.

and many others...

These projects share their designs openly and enable others to learn, modify, distribute and build upon their work.

## Participate in the Assembly

The Free/Libre and Open Source Hardware Assembly provides a space to learn, share, and collaborate. Participants can discuss how to contribute to FLOSH, understand its challenges, and explore its possibilities.
